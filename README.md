## Description

> Much more than a powerful, personalized schedule for students and teachers at the College Preparatory School.
> 
> **SCHEDULE**
> 
> CPS Campus brings you an all new experience for an all new school year. A new rotating schedule dynamically populates with your customized courses, and notifies you when your classes begin and end. Want to create a meeting? Just long press on any block in your schedule to create an event in your calendar. Want to export your schedule? Tap on the share button to do so and add school holidays to your calendar. Style your courses with the all-new Palette Studio. And you can add schedule widgets to your Home Screen. 
> 
> **HOME**
> 
> The Home page intelligently organizes your current and next classes, Common Classroom details, RHF points and drop-in classes, and more. And you can rearrange and configure the information that's displayed, and dive into to designated pages from the top.
> 
> **CLUBS & SPORTS**
> 
> Follow the student clubs and athletic teams you join to receive personalized notifications for their meetings or games. View their individual pages for leaders, members, links, upcoming meetings, future games, and search for just what you need anytime. And if you're a club leader, you can customize your page with link, plus request a meeting or bake sale straight from the app.
> 
> **CAMPUS ID**
> 
> Also, everything—that means schedule, clubs, and sports—securely syncs across your Apple devices via your Campus ID, including CPS Campus for macOS. Your Campus ID gives you access to the new school Directory as well, where you can see other students’ classes, socials, clubs, and more. And with powerful privacy features, you’re in control of what you share with others.
